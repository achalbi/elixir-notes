# Elixir Notes

These are study notes that I'm writing while learning the [Elixir programming
language](http://elixir-lang.org/). Reviewing the notes help me find my
bearings when I come back to Elixir after a break while the language is still
new to me. I also find that writing makes what I'm learning more sticky. You
can use this content to get a quick overview of Elixir and to get a feel for
the language.

The following topics are covered:

 * [Built-in Types](built-in-types.md)
 * [Functions and Modules](functions-modules.md)
 * [Flow Control Structures](flow-control-structures.md)
 * [Error Handling](error-handling.md)
